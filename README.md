Hello everyone, happy to see you all here. Let's discuss a very major topic of electronics in detail with some of my experience with this. PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is widely used in electronics to get rid of wires and excess soldering. The base of PCB is made using clad material. It is a hard layer on which we can draw copper traces as per our circuit requirements. The circuit can be completed using a variety of electronics components. Nowadays, PCBs are used in every electronic circuit because of their simplicity. The circuits are going on-increment day-by-day and electronics components sizes are getting decrease. PCBs in smart devices like mobiles, laptops, tablets, etc, having a large number of electronics components in a very small area.

PCBs can be designed at home but sometimes they might show errors. PCB-making at home is a very difficult process. Designing PCB can be done using a simple permanent marker.

To give a professional look to PCBs, we can design the circuit using software like EasyEda. Can upload the sketch in Gerber format to China's most trusted PCB manufacturing company JLCPCB. Which provides the extra-high quality of PCBs for just $2 for 2,4 or 6 layers-5 pieces. Even PCB are delivered all over the world including INDIA. That's how JLCPCB is also available in India.

    Before going deeper into that let me first explain the basics of PCB with you. PCBs are mainly divided into 3 types.
1) Single-sided:
PCB having only one side copper traces on clad board and another side is used to place the electronics components is known as single-layered PCB. This type of PCB limits the circuit. Sometimes we need to put the jumper to avoid short-circuit.

2) Double-sided:
This is the most loved PCB by electronics makers and creators due to its simplicity. PCB having copper traces on both sides of the clad board. A double layer offers more space to put components on the same PCB.

 We can make the connection between both layers of copper traces by using a small point called via.

3) Multi-sided:
In actual this PCB is used in most dense electronics components circuits. like the motherboard of a computer or mobile. This offers (2-16) layers on a single board but the components can only be placed on the top-most and bottom-most layers. 

we can't put the components in between the layers, layers are very thin and made of copper. Via is used to make the connections between layers of this PCB. Making these PCBs are very difficult, although machines can handle all the work.

Before going to the topics of MACHINES let's know about the main part of a PCB.

1) Substrate ( Provide strength):
The substrate is used to provide strength to PCB, it gives hardness to PCB. The substrate material can be of different types. Two mostly used substrate materials are:

Clad (substrate used by most Indian manufacturers) - 50% strength 

Fiberglass (used by top PCB manufacturers)

2) Copper layers: 
The copper layer consists of copper traces, this is a network of small long lines of copper joining one part to other. This is used to get rid of wiring and excess soldering.

3) Solder mask:
The solder mask is used to cover the copper traces of PCB. To keep them safe from oxidization and short-circuit. This gives a professional look to PCB to give a suitable color to it. Generally, a mixture of light colors with varnish is used.

4) Silk-screen:
Silkscreen is used to represent the LOGO of the brand or manufacturer on the solder mask (colored painted uppermost layer). This is just for the purpose of identifying Pin numbers or component names.

Finally, we came to the topic of machines and the PCB manufacturing process:

1) PCB Design:
Talking about professional PCBs, the design of circuits matters very much. For designing the PCB we need better software. so that it can cover all the steps for making a good PCB design.


some Best PCB designing software are: Kicad, Eagle, EasyEDA

For making the design of PCBs, we need Proper circuit schematics and circuit diagrams. circuit schematics includes electronic components that are available in symbols in software. Designing also includes connections between the electronics components, that can be easily proceed using these extraordinary softwares.

2) The Print:
 For PCB copper traces we need PCB etching. That can be done using a simple marker so that in process of PCB etching area under the marker remains the same and all other copper areas were removed by the chemicals (Ferrous chloride). but in these big companies, all the work was done using machines and processors inside them. For print, a temporary black layer is used on the PCB and the Etching process is done using the giant PCB etching machines.

3) Substrate:
This material provides strength to PCB and this is the main base of every PCB. FIBERGLASS is used in it, fiberglass will turn into the shape by the cutting and grinding machines inside the PCB manufacturing company. 

4) Layers:
a laminate is created using the blueprints of design, laminate is covered using photo-sensitive material, also known as the resist. The UV light rays under room temperature are used to maker the material hard.

5) Inspection: 
Without interfering with the photo-sensitive layers the alignment of different layers in PCB is checked many times. A punch machine is used to align the layers according to the holes and via.

6) Drilling: 
Drill machines with X-ray sensors are used is make the holes in the PCB in right place. X- rays are used to detect the proper drill spots.

In actuality, it is a drill press that can be capable to hole more than 5 PCBs at a time.

7) PCB Plating:
After drilling, a chemical is used to fuse all the layers at the right place on the substrate this process is known as PCB plating.

8) Tinning:
This process is used to cover the outer copper layer at the time of fusing the layers.

9) Last Etching:
This process is used to remove the extra unwanted copper from the mainboard, while tin in the outer layers keeps protecting the copper layers and holes.

10) Solder Mask:
This is the process of covering the PCB with a mixture of varnish and light color layers. so that the copper area can be protected.

JLC PCB provides more than 6 types of colors in the soldering mask layer. 

the solder mask layer is heated in the oven to obtain the desired colors at the output.

11) Silk Screening:
Generally, the logos and pin numbers identified in this process by (white/ black)

colors. Silk-screen was made using this type of machine.

12) Final Surface Finish:
final finishing of the PCB includes silver or gold finishing on I/O pins and holes. This is used to cover the holes and pins with a thin layer of copper having a silver or gold color.

13) Electrical Testing:
testing of the circuit is done using probe test, checking all the connections, continuity of the circuit, I/O ports, and short circuits.

14) Final Cutting Process:
At last, the process of cutting PCBs from the panel is done using a cutter machine. IN the software penalizing options are given for the PCBs. Through this, we can create two or three copies of the same PCB at the same price.

JLCPCB:
JLCPCB is one of the best PCB manufacturing company. Last week they started dealing with ALuminium PCBs, which are very useful in circuits having heating problems. Like audio amplifiers, Led panels, etc.

$2 for 5 PCB:

JLCPCB provides 5 pieces of 2 layered PCB just for $2. I think this is the best deal because other PCB manufacturers cost us around $10 for the same PCB quantity and quality.

$5 for 4 layer PCB:  https://jlcpcb.com/IAT
More the layers more are the circuit complexity. JLCPCB is making efforts of doing its best in this price range. Of course, we will get superior quality products.  

More Services from JLCPCB:
JLC PCB not only deals in PCBs but also in SMT-assembly services. the products are provided by LCSC (electronics store). SMT stencils are also available while dealing with Surface-mounted electronics devices.
